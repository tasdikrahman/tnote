## Contributing

This app was created in a timespan of 2 hours while learning to use peewee. So don't be shy to make some PR's here :smile:

**NOTE**

I am using **Sqlite** as the **db** and the **schema** of the database is like this

```sql
$ sqlite3 diary.db 
-- Loading resources from /home/tasdik/.sqliterc

SQLite version 3.8.6 2014-08-15 11:46:33
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite> .schema
CREATE TABLE "diaryentry" ("id" INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, "title" VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, "content" TEXT NOT NULL, "timestamp" DATETIME NOT NULL, "tags" VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL);
sqlite> .tables
diaryentry
sqlite> pragma table_info([diaryentry]);
cid         name        type        notnull     dflt_value  pk

0           id          INTEGER     1                       1         
1           title       VARCHAR(25  1                       0         
2           content     TEXT        1                       0         
3           timestamp   DATETIME    1                       0         
4           tags        VARCHAR(25  1                       0 
sqlite>
